    "description": "Innovative in design, but still true to our DNA. Functional, aesthetic, and robust as well as high quality - without showing off. Large indexes ensure optimum readability. The outer bezel is reminiscent of outdoor measuring instruments. The double-domed sapphire crystal provides optimal scratch resistance, a clear view, and a sophisticated look. The chronograph-typical totalizers have been deliberately designed in a striking way. By pressing the pusher to trigger the stop function, seconds and minutes can be measured, while the chronograph second hand on the main dial measures the seconds during the stopping process. Available in white, black, and midnight blue.",
